# 👨🏼‍💻 Deploying A 3 Tier H.A Web Application on AWS 👨🏼‍💻
In this runbook, we will discuss/implement the a PHP app deployment with multi-tier architecture on AWS. We will be using the Amazon EC2 service on AWS for Linux server, Apache Web server and PHP. For the Mysql database, we will use the RDS service on AWS as a separate micro service and will be serving a seperate layer based on the architecture. We will connect the webserver to the app and the app with the database to achieve a multi-tier application architecture deployment. To engage this project, you need to have a registered AWS account and at this point, I assume that you already have one.
